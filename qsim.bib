	abstract = {In this paper we develop a gapless theory of BEC which can be applied to both trapped and homogeneous gases at zero and finite temperature. The many-body Hamiltonian for the system is written in a form which is approximately quadratic with higher order cubic and quartic terms. The quadratic part is diagonalized exactly by transforming to a quasiparticle basis, while the non-quadratic terms are dealt with using first and second order perturbation theory. The conventional treatment of these terms, based on factorization approximations, is shown to be inconsistent. Infra-red divergences can appear in individual terms of the perturbation expansion, but we show analytically that the total contribution beyond quadratic order is finite. The resulting excitation spectrum is gapless and the energy shifts are small for a dilute gas away from the critical region, justifying the use of perturbation theory. Ultra-violet divergences can appear if a contact potential is used to describe particle interactions. We show that the use of this potential as an approximation to the two-body T-matrix leads naturally to a high-energy renormalization. The theory developed in this paper is therefore well-defined at both low and high energy and provides a systematic description of Bose-Einstein condensation in dilute gases. It can therefore be used to calculate the energies and decay rates of the excitations of the system at temperatures approaching the phase transition.},

	abstract = {We study the truncated Wigner method (TWM) applied to a weakly interacting Bose condensed gas perturbed away from thermal equilibrium. The idea of the method is to generate an ensemble of classical fields which samples the Wigner function of the initial thermal density operator, and to evolve each field with the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). In the first part of the paper we improve the sampling technique over our previous work and we test its accuracy against the exactly solvable model of the ideal gas. In the second part of the paper we investigate the conditions of validity of the TWM. For short evolution times the time-dependent Bogoliubov approximation is valid for almost pure condensates. The requirement that the TWM reproduces the Bogoliubov prediction leads to the constraint that the number of field modes must be smaller than the number of particles.For longer times the nonlinear dynamics of the noncondensed modes plays an important role. To demonstrate this we analyse the case of a 3D spatially homogeneous Bose condensed gas and we test how well TWM reproduces Beliaev-Landau damping.We have identified the mechanism which limits the validity of the TWM: the initial classical fields, driven by the time-dependent GPE, thermalise to a classical field distribution at a temperature T\_class larger than the initial temperature T. When T\_class significantly exceeds T a spurious damping is observed in the simulation. This leads to the second condition for the TWM, T\_class-T<<T, which requires that the maximum energy of the Bogoliubov modes does not exceed a few k\_B T.},
